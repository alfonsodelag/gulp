## Gulp
Gulp is a tool developed by NodeJS that helps you automate tasks such as compiling different languages, minifying code, auto-refreshing the browser when you modify your code, validating syntax, compressing files, creating custom automations and much more!

## Requirements
-You must create a git repository that ignores the production version of the generated assets.
-Create a clear and orderly directory structure
-Both the code and the comments must be written in English
-Use the camelCase code style for defining variables and functions
-Remember that it is important to divide the tasks into several sub-tasks so that in this way you can associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commit
-You should try as much as possible that the commits and the planned tasks are the same
-Delete files that are not used or are not necessary to evaluate the project
